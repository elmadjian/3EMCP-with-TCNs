        Identify and label fixation intervals as 'FIX' and some others as 'NOISE'.

          a certain spread threshold (@self.PREFILTERING_INTERVAL_SPREAD_THRESHOLD_DEGREES) are marked as fixations.

          remaining data and a non-fixation onset (offset) is marked every
          time speed rises above (fell below) threshold (@self.SPEED_THRESHOLD_DEGREES_PER_SEC).
        - There are two ways for speed calculation: spread and speed.
            -'speed': speed from start point to end point is larger than
                      threshold.
            -'spread': maximum moving speed of either x or y is larger than
                       threshold.
          Data with speed below threshold are labeled as 'FIX'.
        - Finally, non-fixation episodes longer than @self.MINIMAL_SP_DURATION_MICROSEC are kept as 'UNKNOWN',
          the shorter ones are labeled as 'NOISE' (these are fairly dynamic episodes that however should not be SP).
